The app *Planner Pro – Personal Organizer* is a personal planner application that 
has a calendar system for managing deadlines and to-do lists. Our app will differ 
by having several fixed categories of planning beyond a mere calendar planner with 
deadlines and to-do lists.

# FitNotes - Gym Workout Log

The app *FitNotes – Gym Workout Log* is a workout log tool which allows you to track exercises, sets, and reps,
create workout plans, and see graphs of your progress. Our health and fitness planner will differ by also including
a weight and bodyfat logger, a bodyfat calculator, and a calorie management system. 

# Dollarbird
https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/dollarbird/id1214299218

The app *Dollarbird* is a personal planner available on iOS. It helps its users organize their finances and provides a calendar interface that attempts to forecast monthly expenditure.

Some features it includes are:

1) A calendar that helps users visualize and project future expenditures.
2) A graphical breakdown through charts and graphs of historical and future planned spending.
3) A categorical breakdown of spending based on AI pattern recognition.
4) An option for a collaborative mode in which multiple accounts can be synced to be communally tracked and managed through their spending.

This application focuses primarily on financial planning and management and fails to include a few key features that our application aims to provide. 
For example, Dollarbird does not provide a time management system or a notification system that our application aims to provide. 
However, this tradeoff allows Dollarbird to provide extensive analysis of users' expenditure through machine learning technologies 
that categorize spending which is beyond our application's scope. 

An important feature of a third-party financial planner is that it does not require personal information, especially banking details. 
Although, without directly linking a bank account to the app, a user is required to manually enter all their expenditures. 
A way that we aim to solve this inconvenience in our application is to provide a feature that reads csv or pdf bank statements and automatically loads 
them into a user's account.
 
Now our multi-planner product is ideal for those who have really disorganized personal lives and want to start 
managing their lives better. This tool is a great way to start that process of organization. In addition, 
our planner is ideal for the really organized: those who want to systematically track the various aspects of 
their lives. That is, this tool is ideal for the super disorganized and the super organized. 

# Example Users and Scenarios:
# Specific User and Scenario 1:
- Joe is a 33-year-old bartender. Joe’s house is a mess: a reflection of the disorganized state of his life. 
Joe has never committed to his new year’s resolution of getting in shape, constantly misses deadlines, and spends 
beyond his budget. Joe really wants to finally get his disorganized life in order.

# Specific User and Scenario 2:
- Katie is a super organized neat freak. She always puts things back in their place, has organized all her stuff 
in neat and categorized bins, boxes, folders, and the like. She consistently works out early in the morning, pays her bills 
on time, and is two weeks ahead of her schoolwork! However, Katie manages her life on paper: logging and tracking her life on 
lots of paper. Katie wants to be a little more environmentally friendly by not using as much paper and going digital with her planning
and organizing.  

Now competitors most likely have thought and do think of these users and scenarios. The competitors seek to provide 
tools to help with organization, planning, managing, and overall productivity: this applies to the disorganized and 
organized alike. However, competitors have most likely not thought of an all-in-one planner that can have continuously 
added features because such a product might be too large or not focused enough. Competitors might feel it is better to 
focus on one specific type of planner or organizer and optimize it as much as possible to maximize the quality of that 
one specific planner or organizer. However, an all-in-one planner or organizer is more compact and interconnected: a 
benefit which separate planning tools fail to provide. So, compactness and interconnectivity are two of the main advantages our
application will have over the competition.
