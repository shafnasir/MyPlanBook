has a calendar system for managing deadlines and to-do lists. Our app will differ

deadlines and to-do lists. These categorized planners will be able to sync with the
in-app calendar planner to add deadlines and tasks for specific days.

Our media manager will allow a book logging system similar to that of * My Library * but also include the categories 
of owned books, already read, to read in the near future, and currently reading. The media manager will also have a bookmarking function. 
In addition, we will include logging and management systems for tracking gameplay and the consumption of movies or shows: media

Lastly, we will create a new type of planner: a social planner. This planner will have a contact management system that 
will allow you to add personal information about contacts such as birthdays, emails, phone numbers, and so forth. This planner will also 
have a social management system for managing various categories of social endeavours such as interviews, sending emails to a given person, 
romantic dates, sending birthday gifts, and so forth. This planner is ideal for contacts that are hard to reach such as distant relatives or friends 
who you want to keep in touch with.
 
Our multi-planner product is ideal for those who have really disorganized personal lives and want to start 
managing their lives better. This tool is a great way to start that process of organization. In addition, 
our planner is ideal for the really organized: those who want to systematically track the various aspects of 
their lives. That is, this tool is ideal for the super disorganized and the super organized. 

# Example Users and Scenarios:
# Specific User and Scenario 1:
- Joe is a 33-year-old bartender. Joe’s house is a mess: a reflection of the disorganized state of his life. 
Joe has never committed to his new year’s resolution of getting in shape, constantly misses deadlines, and spends 
beyond his budget. Joe really wants to finally get his disorganized life in order.

# Specific User and Scenario 2:
- Katie is a super organized neat freak. She always puts things back in their place, has organized all her stuff 
in neat and categorized bins, boxes, folders, and the like. She consistently works out early in the morning, pays her bills 
on time, and is two weeks ahead of her schoolwork! However, Katie manages her life on paper: logging and tracking her life on 
lots of paper. Katie wants to be a little more environmentally friendly by not using as much paper and going digital with her planning
and organizing.  

Now competitors most likely have thought and do think of these users and scenarios. The competitors seek to provide 
tools to help with organization, planning, managing, and overall productivity: this applies to the disorganized and 
organized alike. However, competitors have most likely not thought of an all-in-one planner that can have continuously 
added features because such a product might be too large or not focused enough. Competitors might feel it is better to 
focus on one specific type of planner or organizer and optimize it as much as possible to maximize the quality of that 
one specific planner or organizer. However, an all-in-one planner or organizer is more compact and interconnected: a 
benefit which separate planning tools fail to provide.
