# The Definition of Done 

The definition of done applies to all the user stories of the product backlog and their associated tasks. A user story is only deemed "done" if it has completed the following criteria stated below:
- **Completion of Tasks**: all the tasks and sub-tasks associated with the user story (stated in the user story's tasks section on Jira) have been completed.
- **Code Review**: the sprint "Submission Reviewer" must review and confirm that the all tasks' requirements have been met; all Criteria of Satisfaction is verified.
- **Testing**: the tasks meet the non-functional and functional requirements after exposing any bugs/issues discovered in testing phase.
- **Integration**: the user story's development branch is successfully merged into the projects master branch without conflicts or conflicts are resolved as a result of the merge and do not compromise the functionality of other external components.
